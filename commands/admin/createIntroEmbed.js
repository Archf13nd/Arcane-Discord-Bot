The server has a lot of channels. To keep things clean and tidy I have made a lot of channels role specific. To access the channels you want, or hide them again in the future, we have a channel found in the settings category called role-manager. You can find the settings category just below the chat category. Be sure to use the role manager to explore our sever and tailor it for you. There is no need for a list of rules. Just donâ€™t be toxic towards others or make them feel unwelcome. We are all here to chat, play games, and have fun. Anyone is welcome. To access the server, type 'unlock' in chat. We are expecting you :)"
